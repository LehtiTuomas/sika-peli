Throw the pigs game, written in html, css and JavaScript.

This was my first attempt to do something of my own with JavaScript. Throw the pigs is one of my favorite games, so I decided to make it an online game. The game works just as I planned, but there is somewhat whacky code in some places. I was also too lazy to figure out all the combinations for the pigs, so the game is somewhat limited compared to the original game.

This was very good project to learn DOM- manipulation and basic JavaScript.
This game will NOT work on a phone size display.
